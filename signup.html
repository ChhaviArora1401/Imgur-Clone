                    believe that offering an alternative to the status quo of paid advertisements can lead to better
                    internet products and experiences that are user-focused.

                    also get access to everything else that Coil has to offer in their growing network without the need
                    for a ga-zillion more subscriptions.

                    handle the logistics, and we receive a percentage of your membership fee from Coil. This sort of
                    direct support gives us the freedom to build a better, more community-focused experience, less
                    reliant on advertising.
