                Coil’s mission is to re-imagine the way the web monetizes. We’ve partnered with Coil because
                we
                believe that offering an alternative to the status quo of paid advertisements can lead to
                better
                internet products and experiences that are user-focused.
                <br>
                <br>
                Coil is one membership that unlocks special content and features across the internet on
                sites like
                Twitch, Cinnamon, Simmer, with many more to come. In addition to your Imgur Emerald
                benefits, you’ll
                also get access to everything else that Coil has to offer in their growing network without
                the need
                for a ga-zillion more subscriptions.
                <br>
                <br>
                Your privacy is Coil’s top priority. They won’t sell your information, track your browsing
                habits,
                or use your data any way outside of your membership. They can totally sit at our lunch
                table. Learn

        How does a Coil membership support Imgur?
    </button>
    <span><i class="fas fa-plus"></i></span>
    <br>
    <div class="panel">Powering Imgur’s content and community isn’t free. We can make money to run
        our business in two
        ways: by showing advertisements, or through Coil. When you subscribe to Coil and browse
        Imgur, they
        handle the logistics, and we receive a percentage of your membership fee from Coil. This
        sort of
        direct support gives us the freedom to build a better, more community-focused experience,
        less
        reliant on advertising.
        <br>
        <br>
        If supporting Imgur through Coil doesn’t appeal to you, the free Imgur will still be there
        just the
        way you know and love it today. (Pls whitelist us in your adblocker 🙏).
