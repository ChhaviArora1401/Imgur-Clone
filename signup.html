                    What exactly am I getting when I get Imgur Emerald?
                    Your Emerald experience is free from advertising on our iOS app, Android app, and desktop website, including display ads and promoted posts. Imgurians with Emerald will still receive Imgur announcements/promotions such as new product features and community events, even if they‚Äôre sponsored. You‚Äôll get a special trophy for your Imgur profile and you‚Äôll unlock fun meme-themed avatars that are exclusive to members.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    On the desktop website and Android app only, you unlock the Accolades feature.

                    What are Accolades?
                    <!-- plus sign  -->
<!-- Emerald members can give three Accolades per day to the posts that they think are most <br>
outstanding. Accolades are still only worth 1 upvote, but they give you an opportunity to make <br>
OP‚Äôs feel warm and special inside by championing their content. They‚Äôre rare, so someone is <br>
going to feel super special when they receive one from you! The posts with the most Accolades <br>
get a special designation on Imgur. You don‚Äôt need to be a member to receive an Accolade --<br>
only to give one. Go out and make some days brighter. Learn more -->

                    What is Coil? What do they do with my information?
                  <!-- plus sign  -->
                  Coil‚Äôs mission is to re-imagine the way the web monetizes. We‚Äôve partnered with Coil because we believe that offering an alternative to the status quo of paid advertisements can lead to better internet products and experiences that are user-focused.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Coil is one membership that unlocks special content and features across the internet on sites like Twitch, Cinnamon, Simmer, with many more to come. In addition to your Imgur Emerald benefits, you‚Äôll also get access to everything else that Coil has to offer in their growing network without the need for a ga-zillion more subscriptions.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Your privacy is Coil‚Äôs top priority. They won‚Äôt sell your information, track your browsing habits, or use your data any way outside of your membership. They can totally sit at our lunch table. Learn more at

                How does a Coil membership support Imgur?

                Powering Imgur‚Äôs content and community isn‚Äôt free. We can make money to run our business in two ways: by showing advertisements, or through Coil. When you subscribe to Coil and browse Imgur, they handle the logistics, and we receive a percentage of your membership fee from Coil. This sort of direct support gives us the freedom to build a better, more community-focused experience, less reliant on advertising.
                <br>
                <br>
                If supporting Imgur through Coil doesn‚Äôt appeal to you, the free Imgur will still be there just the way you know and love it today. (Pls whitelist us in your adblocker üôè).
